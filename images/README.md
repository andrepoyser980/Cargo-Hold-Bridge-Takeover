# Images

This directory contains all visual artifacts used in the **Bridge Takeover Threat Hunt**.

Images are organized by purpose (overview, attack flow, timeline, evidence) to make the investigation easy to follow and to support clear storytelling of attacker behavior, impact, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

All images are referenced directly in the main report and supporting documentation.

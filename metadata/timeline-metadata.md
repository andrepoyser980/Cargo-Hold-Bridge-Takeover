# Timeline Metadata

All timestamps in this investigation are recorded in **UTC**.

Timeline events were correlated using:
- Process creation times
- File creation and deletion events
- Network connection timestamps
- Remote session metadata

Where multiple events occurred within short intervals, sequence ordering was determined using process IDs and parent-child relationships.

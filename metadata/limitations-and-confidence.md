# Limitations and Confidence

## Limitations
- No packet capture or firewall logs available
- No cloud identity or SaaS audit logs reviewed
- Potential log retention gaps outside the investigation window

## Analyst Confidence
Despite telemetry limitations, confidence in findings is **high** due to:
- Consistent behavioral patterns
- Repeated attacker techniques
- Clear evidence of staging and exfiltration
- Verified command execution and file artifacts
